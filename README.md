# Teannie Binns Portfolio  

 

## Description 
The motivation for this project was to create a portfolio that I can use when job searching. I will be updating this portfolio throughout the bootcamp as I learn more skills.

I built this project to showcase the skills I learnt throughout this bootcamp. This portfolio will keep all of my skills and projects in once place so it is easier to showcase. 

I learnt that I will be judged from this portfolio and to use it to sell my skills as much as possible. I learnt how to use grids, compare background images and images and how to layer text on top of images. 

 

## Installation 
N/A 

 

## Usage 
-Use the links at the top of the page to be taken to the required section.

-The 'work' images will take you to a separate page showing my work. 

 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax: 

 

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
